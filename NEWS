GNOME Tetravex 3.35.2
======================

Many changes, again! First, the current game is being saved if the window is
closed, and a button was added to restore it (you can also directly restore,
using the “--restore” command-line option). The game can also be played with
the keyboard (using arrows), and finally you can move all the tiles from one
of the half-board using the mouse, by clicking on an empty border tile (even
if this function is for now hidden). Also, Tetravex can for now be played in
command-line, using the “--cli” option (see “--cli help” documentation; have
also a look to the “Distributors” section below). And finally on a technical
side, GNOME Tetravex should be D-Bus activatable, what is more future-proof.

Distributors: using the “meson configure -Dbuild_gui=false -Dbuild_cli=true”
options, you can build a different binary, `gnome-tetravex-cli`, that can be
co-installed with `gnome-tetravex` (normally). It allows to play Tetravex in
command-line, but it does not require the Gtk library, only GLib. You surely
want to package it for installations made without a graphical interface. :·)

GNOME Tetravex 3.35.1
======================

Many changes! The most visible is the end of a game, where instead of having
the Scores dialog popped-up, the ranking is overlaid on the now-empty right
part of the board. Or maybe it is instead the default new theme, designed by
Jakub Steiner, or the fact that multiple themes are available (including the
old one, under the name Nostalgia). Or maybe even the undo/redo functions, a
great addition to the gameplay. There are also many many small improvements,
like the fact the puzzle will not anymore start already solved, some drawing
refinements, or the fact scores are now displayed with a higher precision...
