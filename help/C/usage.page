    <p>
      The game window is divided into two boxes: the one on the right side of 
      the window contains the pieces that needs to be arranged; the one on the 
      left side of the window is where the pieces from the right box will be 
      arranged and moved. Each piece is divided into four little triangles 
      containing a number.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scope of the game is to position the pieces so that only two identical 
      numbers are next to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not possible to position the pieces so that different number are next
      to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game is completed when you have positioned all the pieces in their right
      positions.
    </p>
    <note>
      <p>
        When you start <app>GNOME Tetravex</app>, the game will start immediately,
        and the time will start counting.
