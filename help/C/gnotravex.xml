       The tiles are divided into four, you must position them so that only
       two numbers that are the same are next to each other. The game wil not
       let you position the tiles so that different numbers are next to each
       other. You position the pieces by dragging them from their current
       position either in the right hand box or the main box to their new
       position. These moves are not permanent and can be readily reversed.
       You may also move all the pieces in the left hand box at once by using the commands:
	<menuchoice>
	 <guisubmenu>Move</guisubmenu>
         <guimenuitem>Left/Right/Up/Down</guimenuitem>
	</menuchoice>

       The game is completed when you have positioned all the squares in the
       right positions. When you have completed the game you are shown your
       ranking in the high scores table, if you get a high enough score.
       If you have used either Hint or Solve your score will not be included 
       in the high scores table.

  are too small, resizing the window will change the size of the tiles.
