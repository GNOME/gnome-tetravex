    <title>Look for a single number</title>
    <p>
      When you start a new game, look for a single number, or a number that has no
      similar numbers that can be placed next to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have one such number, that piece is a valid starting piece, since you
      know where it has to be placed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the bigger the size of the board, the harder is to find such a 
      number.
