Gnotravex
=========

Gnotravex is a small game for GNOME. The idea is originally 
from a game called "Tetravex".

  The goal of the game is to place all squares so that the numbers
on their sides match. It is impossible to place a square beside 
another square without the numbers matching. When all squares are 
placed, the game is won, and over. 
  It's possible to choose different sizes on the board from 2x2 to
6x6.
